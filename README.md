# About

Byotics was created at the 2016 Global Game Jam in Toronto, and it uses single-celled organisms to play the classic arcade game Pong. 

This project incorporates general foundational cocnepts of biology, computer science, augmented reality together where others might want to incorporate into their own projects as an interest project in biocomputation. 

Lab T.O. Co-working hosted a demo night on June 17th, 2016, bringing access to these technologies, under the guidance of Byotics co-creator Constant Mori
